Rock Paper Scissors game with UI by Manon Lef

30/05 started with copying my browser console game to build a UI upon.

Made the basic UI as the exercise stated. When I'm further ahead with TOP I'll go beyond the exercise and add a nice looking UI as well.

One thing to get back to is removing the feature I added for playing a new game with a confrim window. 
I thought it was nice to add but due to the asynchronous nature, different browsers give different results. 
Some will display the latest score and then show the confirm window. Others will not update the score as stated in the script because the confirm window stops the process 
of DOM manipulation and there's not really any guidance on how to deal with this in the dev docs as far as I can tell. 

For now it's fine. It works as intended and the score is also displayed in the confirm window.
