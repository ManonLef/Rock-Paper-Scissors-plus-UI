//consider removing the confirm window. The win() and loss() functions seem to execute before the DOM is manipulated 
//to also show the final score. This gives inconsistent behaviour across browsers.
//Only Firefox first displays score in div 'results'. Chrome and Safari go straight to the confirm window.
//confirm (and alert etc) All these methods are modal: they pause script execution and donâ€™t allow the visitor to interact 
//with the rest of the page until the window has been dismissed.

//adding another game is not part of the exercise so this hassle isn't needed, I made it a feature for the future fancy UI
